Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using Git because it provides a way to track 
and manage changes in a project. It allows multiple people to work together 
without overwriting each other's work. It also supports experimentation 
through branching and keeps a history so that we can convert back to 
previous versions if needed. In addition, Git also ensures that every 
contributor has a full copy/backup of the project, making it easier to 
recover data. Git also records who makes each of the changes, allowing for 
transparency.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to many fields including healthcare. 
In healthcare, data science can be used to analyze medical images, such as 
X-rays or MRIs, to help detect conditions like cancer earlier and more 
accurately than traditional methods. This can assist doctors in making 
faster and more precise diagnoses.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging puts the changes together and adds a special commit showing where the branches joined, keeping the full history of both branches. Meanwhile, rebasing takes the changes and moves them on top of the other branch, making the history look neat and straight, but it changes the order and IDs of the commits.
