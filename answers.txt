Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using Git because it provides a way to track 
and manage changes in a project. It allows multiple people to work together 
without overwriting each other's work. It also supports experimentation 
through branching and keeps a history so that we can convert back to 
previous versions if needed. In addition, Git also ensures that every 
contributor has a full copy/backup of the project, making it easier to 
recover data. Git also records who makes each of the changes, allowing for 
transparency.
